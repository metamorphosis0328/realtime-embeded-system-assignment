Modifications for use in the ENG5220 Gomoku AI Robot System (2025):

- Ported the driver from Arduino to Raspberry Pi, using Linux's I2C interface (/dev/i2c-X).
- Replaced Arduino-specific APIs (e.g., Wire.h, delay()) with standard C++ and POSIX-compatible code.
- Restructured the driver into a C++ class with hardware abstraction for integration into a multi-module real-time system.
